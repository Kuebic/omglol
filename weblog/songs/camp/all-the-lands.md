{sov: VERSE 1}
[C]I have been [G]wandering all [Am]over this [F]world
[C]Looking for [G]something I [F]just couldn’t [C]find

[C]Where will I [G]find my [F]peace of [C]mind
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 1}
[Am]   All the [G]lands that I [D/F#]loved    [D7]
[G]    All the [D/F#]seas that I’ve [Em]sailed    [G/D]
[C]Miles and [D]years roll [Em]by me
It’s been [C]such a [D]lonely [G]trail [/]  [C]  [/]  [|]
[G] [/] [G] [D7] [G] [|]

{sov: VERSE 2}
[C]Finally a [G]welcome felt [Am]deep in my [F]soul
I [C]know I will [G]find it in this [F]city of [C]gold

My [C]heart’s pouring [G]open [F]please [C]take it for keeps

[Am]   All the [G]lands that I [D/F#]loved    [D7]

{sov: VERSE 3}
[C]Our love’s cre[G]ating a [Am]world full of [F]hope
[C]Faces are [G]glowing in the [F]fresh morning [C]sun

[C]Father is [G]laughing our [F]new life’s [C]begun
