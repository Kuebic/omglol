{sov: VERSE 1}
[C]I have been [G]wandering all [Am]over this [F]world
[C]Looking for [G]something I [F]just couldn’t [C]find
[C]Seems like I’m [G]moving in [Am]search of my[D7]self
[C]Where will I [G]find my [F]peace of [C]mind
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 1}
[Am]   All the [Am7]lands that I [D7]loved
[G]    All the [D]seas that I’ve [Em]sailed
[C]   Miles and [D]years roll [Em]by me
It’s been [C]such a [D]lonely [G]trail  [C]  [G]
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
[C]Finally a [G]welcome felt [Am]deep in my [F]soul
I [C]know I will [G]find it in this [F]city of [C]gold
[C]People so [G]friendly I [Am]know I will [D7]meet
My [C]heart’s pouring [G]open [F]please [C]take it for keeps
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 2}
[Am]    All the [Am7]lands that I [D7]loved
[G]    All the [D]seas that I’ve [Em]sailed
[C]  Can’t com[D]pare to [Em]you now,
my [C]heart is [D]in your [G]hands  [C]  [G]
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 3}
[C]Our love’s cre[G]ating a [Am]world full of [F]hope
[C]Faces are [G]glowing in the [F]fresh morning [C]sun
[C]Children are [G]dancing all [Am]races are [D7]one
[C]Father is [G]laughing [F] our [C]new life’s begun
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 3}
[Am]   All the [Am7]lands that I [D7]loved
[G]    All the [D]seas that I’ve [Em]sailed
[C]   Are ful[D]filled in this [Em]moment,
[C]We’ve come [D]home to your [G]love  [C]  [G]
{eoc}
