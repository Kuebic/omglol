{chords}

{sov: VERSE 1}
[G]In the kingdom [C]of our hearts
where [D]dreams like rivers [Em]flow,
[Am]Lives a [D]man of [Bm]many [Em]years
He's [C]always [D7]there you [G]know.

[G]When the lights have [C]all gone out,
and [D]you are snug in [Em]bed
[Am]On a [D]journey [Bm]to the [Em]kingdom
[C]You are [D7]safely [G]led.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[G]Take me through the door[C]way,
[D7]Lead me to the land. [Em]
Where [Am]Father's [D]love is [Bm]flowing [Em]freely
[C]Children [D7]hand in hand. [G]

[G]Take me through the door[C]way,
[D7]Lead me to the land. [Em]
Where [Am]Father's [D]love is [Bm]flowing [Em]freely
[C]Children [D7]hand in hand. [G]
{eoc}

{sov:VERSE 2}
[G]In the house where [C]He abides
the [D]table's set for [Em]all
[Am]There's a [D]fire [Bm]always [Em]burning;
[C]can't you [D7]hear Him [G]call?

[G]There's a path that [C]you can find
if [D7]you believe it's [Em]there,
[Am]Follow [D]it with [Bm]all your [Em]heart,
there's [C]joy for [D7]all to [G]share.
{eov}

{Chorus}
