{words: Rev. Sun Myung Moon}
{music: Korea}
{year: 1962}
{key: C}

Strong bond of heart is the force bringing the world into life,
Joined in a kinship of love, all shall live as one.
Here in the home of our hearts, we'll share evermore.
On this foundation of happiness, we shall live forever.
We're His pride in the heavenly war,
Unified soldiers! Mightily, with one accord,
We shall march, we shall march on!

True men of boundless domain, Magnifying their light,
Glorious beacons of truth, o'er all things of the earth.
From that original word life will spring and grow;
In its expression it gives to all the fulfillment of hope.
We're His pride in the heavenly war,
Unified soldiers! Mightily, His will to do,
We shall march, we shall march on!

Based on the order of God, We'll build truthfulness,
One constant value that gives pledge of eternity.
The highest standard of truth which is raised above,
Will decorate far distant days of radiant goodness.
We're His price in the heavenly war,
Unified soldiers! Mightily, proclaiming,
We shall march, we shall march on!

New culture dawns in the East, Glorious beyond our dreams.
Mankind transformed in its light, shall be one family.
Ever to serve and attend our True Parents' own,l
Without a doubt the world shall be one world of victory.
We're His pride in the heavenly war,
Unified soldiers! Mightily, into that ideal,
We shall march, we shall march on!
