{key: Bb}

{sov: VERSE 1}
[Bb]O, Light of Grace, [Eb]shining above,
[Bb]Lighting my dim [Gm]shadowed [F]way,
[Bb]O, Light of Grace, [Eb]easing my pain,
[Bb]You have shown that [F7]God is [Bb]love.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[Bb]I'll give my life, [Gm]and my [F]love,
[Bb]unto the [Eb]one [F7]God of [Bb]love.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
[Bb]Though clouds may come,
[Eb]hiding His face,
[Bb]Hiding the smile of my [F]God,
[Bb]Though clouds may come,
[Eb]Still He is there,
[Bb]Shining brightly, [F7]Cod is [Bb]love.
{eov}

{c:CHORUS}

{sov: VERSE 3}
[Bb]Amid the storm, [Eb]tossed on the sea,
[Bb]Beacon of hope, guiding [F]me.
[Bb]Amid the storm, [Eb]shelter is near,
[Bb]Trust in Him for [F7]God is [Bb]love.
{eov}

{c:CHORUS}

{sov: VERSE 4}
[Bb]All things decay, [Eb]passing away,
[Bb]Only the light shall re[F]main;
[Bb]All things decay; [Eb]still there is One,
[Bb]True and faithful, [F7]God is [Bb]love.
{eov}

{c:CHORUS}
