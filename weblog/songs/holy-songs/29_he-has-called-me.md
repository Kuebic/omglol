{title: He Has Called Me}
{subtitle: Christian Korean hymn}
{key: C}

The Lord has called and I will go, where He leads me I will follow;
The same in sorrow as in joy; with one heart I follow my Lord.
For none on earth can turn me back, not even death can stop me,
No none on earth can turn me back, not even death can stop me.

To barren valleys piled with bones, I will take the living message;
To Sodom's foul and wretched streets, I will bear the word with love.
I bind my heart, my life to Yours, that it may be an offering,
I bind my heart, my life to Yours, that it may be an offering.

To You belongs our full acclaim, all glory power and honor,
The world's contempt I do not fear, I will gladly bear the cross.
Without esteem, without renown, I only wish to follow,
Without esteem, without renown, I only wish to follow.
