{title: He Has Called Me}
{subtitle: Christian Korean hymn}
{key: C}

The [C]Lord has [F]called and [C]I will [Am]go, where He [G]leads me I [G7]will [C]follow;
The [C]same in [F]sorrow [C]as in [G]joy; with one [D]heart I [D7]follow [G]my Lord.
For [F]none on earth can [C]turn me back, not [F]even [G]death can [C]stop [G]me,
No, [F]none on earth can [C]turn me back, [F] not [C]even death can [G7]stop [C]me.

To [C]barren [F]valleys [C]piled with [Am]bones, I will [G]take the [G7]living [C]message;
To [C]Sodom's [F]foul and [C]wretched [G]streets, I will [D]bear the [D7]word with [G]love.
I [F]bind my heart, my [C]life to Yours, that [F]it may [G]be an [C]offer[G]ing,
I [F]bind my heart, my [C]life to Yours, [F] that [C]it may be an [G7]offer[C]ing.

To [C]You be[F]longs our [C]full ac[Am]claim, all [G]glory [G7]power and [C]honor,
The [C]world's con[F]tempt I [C]do not [G]fear, I will [D]gladly [D7]bear the [G]cross.
With[F]out esteem, with[C]out renown, I [F]only [G]wish to [C]fol[G]low,
With[F]out esteem, with[C]out renown, [F] I [C]only wish to [G7]fol[C]low.
