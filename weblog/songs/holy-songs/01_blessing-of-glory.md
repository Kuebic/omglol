{c:verse 1}
Now the [C]light of [Am]glory a[C]rises like the sun that [F]shines on [C]high;    [G7]
Now a[Am]waken into [Em]freedom, O re[C]vive, you spirits, [F]O re[C]vive!
Wake the [Am]mountains and the [Dm/F]val[F]leys; bring [Dm7]alive the [G7]springs of the [C]earth.  [G]
Light the [C]world for[Am]ever with the [Em]Light of [Am]your re[Em]birth.  [C7]
Light the [F]world fore[C]ver [Am]with the [C]Light of [G7]your re[C]birth.

{c:verse 2}
We are [C]called to [Am]bring back the [C]glory to the life of [F]God a[C]bove;    [G7]
Now the [Am]Lord in His [Em]greatness fills the [C]universe with [F]tender [C]love,
Ever [Am]seeking souls a[Dm/F]wa[F]kened, ever [Dm7]calling [G7]them to be [C]free. [G7]
How [C]shall I at[Am]tend Him who is [Em]cal[Am]ling to [Em]me?  [C7]
How shall [F]I at[C]tend [Am]Him who is [C]cal[G7]ling to [C]me?

{c:verse 3}
From the [C]dark of [Am]death I a[C]waken and rejoice to [F]live in [C]grace;   [G7]
When the [Am]one who came to [Em]save me holds me [C]tenderly in [F]His em[C]brace;
How can [Am]I return the [Dm/F]bles[F]sing? Though in [Dm7]all my [G7]life I will [C]try.   [G7]
What a [C]blessing of [Am]glory, to re[Em]joice e[Am]ternal[Em]ly!   [C7]
What a [F]blessing of [C]glory, to re[C]joice e[G7]ternal[C]ly!

{c:verse 4}
Now He [C]lifts me up to em[Am]brace me in the blessing [F]that is [C]mine  [G7]
What a [Am]blessing to re[Em]ceive Him in a [C]love so tender [F]and de[C]vine
How can [Am]I return the [Dm/F]bles[F]sing? Though in [Dm7]all my [G7]life I will [C]try   [G]
I can [C]never stop [Am]feeling how un[Em]wor[Am]thy am [Em]I.  [C7]
I can [F]never stop feel[C]ing [Am]  how un[C]wor[G7]thy am [C]I!
