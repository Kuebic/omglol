{sov: VERSE 1}
Now the [G]light of [Em]glory a[G]rises like the sun that [C]shines on [G]high;    [D7]
Now a[Em]waken into [Bm]freedom, O re[G]vive, you spirits, [C]O re[G]vive!
Wake the [Em]mountains and the [C]valleys; bring [Am7]alive the [D7]springs of the [G]earth.  [D]
Light the [G]world for[Em]ever with the [Bm]Light of [Em]your re[Bm]birth.  [G7]
Light the [C]world fore[G]ver [Em]  with the [G]Light of [D7]your re[G]birth.

We are [G]called to [Em]bring back the [G]glory to the life of [C]God a[G]bove;    [D7]
Now the [Em]Lord in His [Bm]greatness fills the [G]universe with [C]tender [G]love,
Ever [Em]seeking souls a[C]wakened, ever [Am7]calling [D7]them to be [G]free. [D7]
How [G]shall I at[Em]tend Him who is [Bm]cal[Em]ling to [Bm]me?  [G7]
How shall [C]I at[G]tend [Em]Him who is [G]cal[D7]ling to [G]me?
{eov}

{sov: VERSE 3}
From the [G]dark of [Em]death I a[G]waken and rejoice to [C]live in [G]grace;   [D7]
When the [Em]one who came to [Bm]save me holds me [G]tenderly in [C]His em[G]brace;
How can [Em]I return the [C]blessing? Though in [Am7]all my [D7]life I will [G]try.   [D7]
What a [G]blessing of [Em]glory, to re[Bm]joice e[Em]ternal[Bm]ly!   [G7]
What a [C]blessing of [G]glory, to re[G]joice e[D7]ternal[G]ly!
{eov}

{sov: VERSE 4}
Now He [G]lifts me up to em[Em]brace me in the blessing [C]that is [G]mine  [D7]
What a [Em]blessing to re[Bm]ceive Him in a [G]love so tender [C]and de[G]vine
How can [Em]I return the [C]blessing? Though in [Am7]all my [D7]life I will [G]try   [D7]
I can [G]never stop [Em]feeling how un[Bm]wor[Em]thy am [Bm]I.    [G7]
I can [C]never stop feel[G]ing [Em]  how un[G]wor[D7]thy am [G]I!
