{verse 1}
Now the [C]light of [Am]glory a[C]rises like the sun that [F]shines on [C]high;    [G7]
Now a[Am]waken into [Em]freedom, O re[C]vive, you spirits, [F]O re[C]vive!
Wake the [Am]mountains and the [Dm/F]val[F]leys; bring [Dm7]alive the [G7]springs of the [C]earth.  [G]
Light the [C]world for[Am]ever with the [Em]Light of [Am]your re[Em]birth.  [C7]
Light the [F]world fore[C]ver [Am]with the [C]Light of [G7]your re[C]birth.

{verse 2}
We are [C]called to [Am]bring back the [C]glory to the life of [F]God a[C]bove;    [G7]
Now the [Am]Lord in His [Em]greatness fills the [C]universe with [F]tender [C]love,
Ever [Am]seeking souls a[Dm/F]wa[F]kened, ever [Dm7]calling [G7]them to be [C]free. [G7]
How [C]shall I at[Am]tend Him who is [Em]cal[Am]ling to [Em]me?  [C7]
How shall [F]I at[C]tend [Am]Him who is [C]cal[G7]ling to [C]me?

{verse 3}
From the dark of death I awaken and rejoice to live in grace;
When the one who came to save me holds me tenderly in His embrace;
How can I return the blessing? Though in all my life I will try.
What a blessing of glory, to rejoice eternally!
What a blessing of glory, to rejoice eternally!

{verse 4}
Now He lifts me up to embrace me in the blessing that is mine
What a blessing to receive Him in a love so tender and devine
How can I return the blessing? Though in all my life I will try
I can never stop feeling how unworthy am I.
I can never stop feeling how unworthy am I!

We are called to bring back the glory to the life of God above;
Now the Lord in His greatness fills the universe with tender love,
Ever seeking souls awakened, ever calling them to be free.
How shall I attend Him who is calling to me?
How shall I attend Him who is calling to me?

From the dark of death I awaken and rejoice to live in grace;
When the one who came to save me holds me tenderly in His embrace;
How can I return the blessing? Though in all my life I will try.
What a blessing of glory, to rejoice eternally!
What a blessing of glory, to rejoice eternally!

Now He lifts me up to embrace me in the blessing that is mine
What a blessing to receive Him in a love so tender and devine
How can I return the blessing? Though in all my life I will try
I can never stop feeling how unworthy am I.
I can never stop feeling how unworthy am I!
