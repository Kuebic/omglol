{music: Duk Chin Kim}
{year: 1955}
{key: G}

We [G]shout with joy, we rise and sing! The [C]Will of [Am]God is [D]done!
A new [G]day dawns and the [Am]dream lives; the [D]Son of [D7]God has [G]come!
Fight [Em]bravely to crush Satan; God's power will be re[B]vealed.
In the [G]children of our [Am]Father, the [D]Youth of [D7]Harmo[G]ny.

The [G]darkness which has covered us in [C]Him has [Am]been dis[D]pelled.
The [G]dawn breaks into [Am]daylight; we [D]ring the [D7]morning [G]bell.
Thirty [Em]billion shall live in the bright white light of [B]truth.
Let us [G]rise and march [Am]forward with [D]Harmo[D7]ny of [G]Youth.

As [G]children of the Heavenly power, we [C]march a[Am]gainst our [D]foe;
The com[G]mand comes and the [Am]world bows to [D]our True [D7]Father's [G]own!
Beaming [Em]light unto the nations, we carry high our [B]dream.
Let us [G]win out for our [Am]Father, we [D]Youth of [D7]Harmo[G]ny!
