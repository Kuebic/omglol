{title: Song of the Spring Breeze}
{subtitle: Korean Song}
{key: C}

[C]Snow and cold wind of the bitter dark night,
[F]Lift off the weight of your cold ruthless [C]hand;
Spring breeze will chase you and [G7]bring flowery [Am]fragrances,
[F]Breathing new [C]life to the [G7]suffocated [C]hills.

[C]Though you most ruthless of winter winds blow,
[F]Doomed in a moment you too shall be [C]calmed;
Spring breeze will chase you and [G7]bring flowery [Am]fragrances,
[F]Breathing new [C]life to the [G7]suffocated [C]hills.

[C]Butterfly awake and you meadow lark of spring,
[F]Our land has suffered this nightmare too [C]long;
Spring breeze will chase you and [G7]bring flowery [Am]fragrances,
[F]Breathing new [C]life to the [G7]suffocated [C]hills.
