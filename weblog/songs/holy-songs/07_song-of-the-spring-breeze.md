{title: Song of the Spring Breeze}
{subtitle:}
{key: C}

Snow and cold wind of the bitter dark night,
Lift off the weight of your cold ruthless hand;
Spring breeze will chase you and bring flowery fragrances,
Breathing new life to the suffocated hills.

Though you most ruthless of winter winds blow,
Doomed in a moment you too shall be calmed;
Spring breeze will chase you and bring flowery fragrances,
Breathing new life to the suffocated hills.

Butterfly awake and you meadow lark of spring,
Our land has suffered this nightmare too long;
Spring breeze will chase you and bring flowery fragrances,
Breathing new life to the suffocated hills.
```
