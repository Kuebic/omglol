{title: When I Behold the Lord}
{subtitle: Christian Japanese hymn}
{time: 6/8}
{key: C}

[C]When I behold the [G]Lord of [C]all, [Dm]my old self [G7]dies a[C]way.
So dies the world of [Em]sinful[Am]ness [Dm]giving [G7]birth to [C]good.
[C]Soon a new self e[F]mer[C]ges, [G]clear and [C]bright and [G]pure; [G7]
[F]Come and behold the [E7]new [Am]life, [Dm]heaven and [G7]earth re[C]born.

[C]Now I behold Je[G]rusa[C]lem, [Dm]city of [G7]loveli[C]ness,
Gently descending [Em]from a[Am]bove, [Dm]ever to [G7]be my [C]own.
[C]Joy never ending is [F]with [C]me, [G]long as the [C]Lord is [G]near; [G7]
[F]Joy ever flows in [E7]sweet[Am]ness, [Dm]river of [G7]precious [C]life.

[C]Kingdom of God e[G]ter[C]nal [Dm]fervently [G7]I de[C]sired;
Heavenly rays so [Em]softy [Am]fall, [Dm]shining the [G7]Sun of [C]Grace.
[C]Springing forth in [F]ripe[C]ness, [G]fruit of the [C]Tree of [G]Life, [G7]
[F]Torment of doubt is [E7]o[Am]ver, [Dm]gone is the [G7]shadow of [C]death.

[C]Torturing every [G]part of [C]me, [Dm]sinfulness [G7]rules my [C]soul.
Still God can raise me [Em]puri[Am]fied, [Dm]giving cre[G7]ation to [C]me.
[C]Letting me live in his [F]pa[C]lace, [G]shining with [C]golden [G]light; [G7]
[F]Boundless His love and [E7]kind[Am]ness, [Dm]boundless [G7]His love for [C]me!
