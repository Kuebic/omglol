[C]O, my [Am]lit[G7]tle [C]lambs, wandering [F]on [C]the [G7]lone[D7]ly [G7]plain.
Some[F]day you [E]may [Am]fall, over[G7]come by your des[C]pair.
[C]Weak, wounded soul, no one will [F]come [G7]to com[C]fort [G7]you;
A[Am]lone, you have [C]no one to [F]love [C]you, no [Am]one to [Dm]bring [G7] the [C]truth.

[C]O, my [Am]lit[G7]tle [C]lambs, here is the [F]One [C]who [G7]heals [D7]your [G7]sins.
O, [F]see how [E]He [Am]carries the [G7]cross and leads the [C]way.
[C]Come, follow Him, He is the [F]shepherd [G7]you [C]have [G7]sought.
With[Am]out Him you [C]tremble in [F]weak[C]ness, far [Am]from the [Dm]path [G7] of [C]life.

[C]O, my [Am]lit[G7]tle [C]lambs, hunger and [F]thirst [C]may [G7]tor[D7]ture [G7]you,
Re[F]ceive Him [E]com[Am]pletely with [G7]all that you [C]have.
[C]You shall be healed, Heavenly [F]strength [G7]will fill [C]your [G7]soul,
And [Am]deep boundless [C]joy will [F]swell [C]with in [Am]you e[Dm]ter[G7]-nal[C]ly.

[C]O, my [Am]lit[G7]tle [C]lambs, now is the [F]time [C]for [G7]joy[D7]ful [G7]heart,
Sing [F]praise to [E]the [Am]Lord; raise your [G7]voices in [C]strength.
[C]Love all mankind, Love every[F]one [G7]through[C]out the [G7]world.
O [Am]give them the [C]love that I [F]give [C]you, O [Am]my [Dm]lit[G7]-tle [C]lambs.

[C]O, my little lambs, wandering [F]on the [D]lonely [G]plain.
Some[F]day you may [Am]fall, over[G]come by your des[C]pair.
[C]Weak, wounded soul, no one will [F]come to [C]comfort [G]you;
A[Am]lone, you have [C]no one to love you, [Am]noone to [G]bring the [C]truth.

[C]O, my little lambs, here is the [F]One who [D]heals your [G]sins.
O, [F]see how He [Am]carries the [G]cross and leads the [C]way.
[C]Come, follow Him, He is the [F]shepherd [C]you have [G]sought.
With[Am]out Him you [C]tremble in weakness, [Am]far from the [G]path of [C]life.

[C]O, my little lambs, hunger and [F]thirst may [D]torture [G]you,
Re[F]ceive Him com[Am]pletely with [G]all that you [C]have.
[C]You shall be healed, Heavenly [F]strength will [C]fill your [G]soul,
And [Am]deep boundless [C]joy will swell with [Am]in you e[G]ternal[C]ly.

[C]O, my little lambs, now is the [F]time for [D]joyful [G]heart,
Sing [F]praise to the [Am]Lord; raise your [G]voices in [C]strength.
[C]Love all mankind, Love every[F]one through[C]out the [G]world.
O [Am]give them the [C]love that I give you, [Am]O my [G]little [C]lambs.
