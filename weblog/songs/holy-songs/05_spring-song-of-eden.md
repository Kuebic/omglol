Come, O ye friends, to the Garden of Eden,
Where the spring blossoms are best;
Joyfully singing together our song,
Friends in our Eden regained,
Here in the Garden together we'll meet,
Singing new songs of joy.

Come, O ye friends, to the Garden of Eden,
Singing new songs of delight;
Joyfully dancing together with song,
Friends in our Eden rejoice,
Here in the Garden together we'll dance,
Singing new songs of joy.

Come, O ye friends, to the Garden of Eden,
Where joy and happiness reign;
Joyfully sharing together our love,
Here in the garden of peace;
Come, ye, O come to the Garden my friends,
Singing new songs of joy.
