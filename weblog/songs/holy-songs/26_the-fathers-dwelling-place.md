The Father's dwelling place is the fountain of our life,
Drawn to the light of eternal day, we abandon the darkness.
May the Word of God in my heart resound
So eternally, to receive His love.
We shall be His pride and delight, children of the Living God.
Into the world of Eden regained, Let's go marching together.

The Father's dwelling place is the throne of new life,
Now our resurrection is come, which we long awaited.
May the Word of God, in my heart resound,
So eternally, to receive His joy.
We shall be His pride and delight, children of the Living God,
Into the world of Eden regained, Let's go singing together.

The Father's dwelling place is the eternal paradise,
Where the blessing He had to reserve will be freely given.
May the Word of God in my heart resound,
So eternally to receive His praise.
We shall be His pride and delight, children of the Living God,
Into the world of Eden regained, Let's go dancing together!
