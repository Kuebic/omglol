I [Am]mo mi ju go do ju go

[Dm]Ka sil chul li issu [E]rya
Im [Am]hyung han il pyun [Dm]tan [Am]shim
[Dm]Ka sil chul [E7]li issu [Am]rya.

Al[Am]though my body perishes
[Dm]And yet one thousand times [Am]dies
My bones become [Dm]a[Am]shes

[E7]Still all my [A7]love and [Dm]all my [Am]heart
[Dm]Unchanging remain with [E]you
My [Am]everlasting [Dm]loyal[Am]ty
[Dm]Unchanging re[E7]mains with [Am]you.
