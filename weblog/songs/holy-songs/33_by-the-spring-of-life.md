{title: By the Spring of Life}
{subtitle: anonymous}
{key: G}

{sov: VERSE 1}
We're [G]marching to the blessed land of [C]Canaan with [G]delight,
We're leaving all our [A7]heavy burdens [D7]here.
At [G]last we are released and free from [C]being slaves to [G]sin,
We're coming to the [D7]blessed spring of [G]life.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[G]Coming to the spring where [C]living water [G]flows;
In glory we'll be [A7]living ever[D7]more.
[G]Going to the land where [C]freely flows the [G]spring,
In glory we'll be [D7]living ever[G]more.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
O [G]guide us with your pillars, Lord, of [C]fire and of [G]cloud,
O give us paths to [A7]follow with our [D7]lives.
The [G]moment that we cross the Jordan [C]River is at [G]hand,
We're coming to the [D7]blessed spring of [G]life.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[G]Coming to the spring where [C]living water [G]flows;
In glory we'll be [A7]living ever[D7]more.
[G]Going to the land where [C]freely flows the [G]spring,
In glory we'll be [D7]living ever[G]more.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 3}
Our [G]thirsting hearts receive with joy the [C]manna from a[G]bove,
Your precious food will [A7]always be our [D7]strength
So [G]if the future finds us lacking [C]we will not des[G]pair
We're coming to the [D7]blessed spring of [G]life.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[G]Coming to the spring where [C]living water [G]flows;
In glory we'll be [A7]living ever[D7]more.
[G]Going to the land where [C]freely flows the [G]spring,
In glory we'll be [D7]living ever[G]more.
