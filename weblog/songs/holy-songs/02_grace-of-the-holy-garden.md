{music: Duk Chin Kim}
{year: 1953}
{key: C}

{sov: VERSE 1}
Grace filling me with golden light, measureless blessing divine;
God gives eternal life to me, perfect rejoicing is mine.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
Glorious the song ringing in my heart for my Father above;
Gratefully I give offering to Him, triumph and glorious love.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
Joy surging like an ocean wave, flowing so deep in my soul;
Hope rises as I go in praise, knowing that man will be whole
{eov}

{CHORUS}

{sov: VERSE 3}
High, limitless eternal life, touching the top of the sky;
Praise filling every part of me blessing that never will die.
{eov}

{CHORUS}

{sov: VERSE 4}
You've chosen me to do Your will, thankful, I vow to he true;
I'm pledging in my heart of hearts; Father, my life is for You.
{eov}

{CHORUS}
