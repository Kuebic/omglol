{subtitle:}
{key: C}

Grace filling me with golden light, measureless blessing divine;
God gives eternal life to me, perfect rejoicing is mine.

	Chorus:
	Glorious the song ringing in my heart for my Father above;
	Gratefully I give offering to Him, triumph and glorious love.

Joy surging like an ocean wave, flowing so deep in my soul;
Hope rises as I go in praise, knowing that man will be whole

High, limitless eternal life, touching the top of the sky;
Praise filling every part of me blessing that never will die.

You've chosen me to do Your will, thankful, I vow to he true;
I'm pledging in my heart of hearts; Father, my life is for You.
```
