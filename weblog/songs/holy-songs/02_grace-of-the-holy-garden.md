[G]Grace filling me with [Bm]golden light,

[G]perfect re[D7]joicing is [G]mine.

[G]Glorious the song [C]ringing in my heart

{eov}

[G]blessing that [D7]never will [G]die.
{eov}

{CHORUS}

{sov: VERSE 4}
[G]You've chosen me to [Bm]do Your will,
[G]thankful, I vow to be [C]true;
[G]I'm pledging in my [Bm]heart of hearts;
[G]Father, my [D7]life is for [G]You.
{eov}

{CHORUS}
