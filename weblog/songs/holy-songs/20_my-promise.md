{title: My Promise}
{words: Hwan Chai Hwang}
{music: Duk Chin Kim}
{year: 1956}
{key: C}

I pledge I will go, I pledge I will go;
Go as my Father has gone.
Tears fall on the path,
Lonely and silent the path of the Father,
Going to suffer the way of the Cross.
Ready to follow His will.
I pledge I will go forward to Him;
Ready to follow His will,
I pledge I will go forward to Him.

I'll follow the way, I'll follow the way;
Follow the path of my Lord.
Though thorny the path,
Now persevere as the brightness is growing,
On to the victory and glorious crown,
Giving my body and soul,
I'll follow the Lord all of the way;
Giving my body and soul, I'll follow the Lord all of the way.

I'm ready to serve, I'm ready to serve.
Serving my Father's desire,
Trials darken the path,
Deep in my heart the desire of the ages,
Fighting until we come home to the Lord,
Satan will bow in defeat,
I'm ready to serve all of my life;
Satan will bow in defeat, I'm ready to serve all of my life.
```
