[C]I [G]pledge I will [Am]go, [G]I [D]pledge I will [G]go; [G7]
[C]Go as my [G7]Father has [C]gone.
Tears [F]fall on the [Em]path,
[Am]Lonely and [F]silent the [Am]path of the [Em]Father,
[F]Going to [G]suffer the [Am]way of the [G]Cross.
[Am]Ready to [E7]follow His [F]will.
[C]I [E]pledge I will [F]go [G]forward [G7]to [C]Him;
[Am]Ready to [E]follow His [F]will,
[C]I [F]pledge I will [C]go [G7]forward to [C]Him.

[C]I'll [G]follow the [Am]way, [G]I'll [D]follow the [G]way;  [G7]
[C]Follow the [G7]path of my [C]Lord.
Though [F]thorny the [Em]path,
[Am]Now perse[F]vere as the [Am]brightness is [Em]growing,
[F]On to the [G]victory and [Am]glorious [G]crown,
[Am]Giving my [E7]body and [F]soul,
[C]I'll [E]follow the [F]Lord [G]all of [G7]the [C]way;
[Am]Giving my [E]body and [F]soul,
[C]I'll [F]follow the [C]Lord [G7]all of the [C]way.

[C]I'm [G]ready to [Am]serve, [G]I'm [D]ready to [G]serve.  [G7]
[C]Serving my [G7]Father's de[C]sire,
Trials [F]darken the [Em]path,
[Am]Deep in my [F]heart the de[Am]sire of the [Em]ages,
[F]Fighting un[G]til we come [Am]home to the [G]Lord,
[Am]Satan will [E7]bow in [F]defeat,
[C]I'm [E]ready to [F]serve [G]all of [G7]my [C]life;
[Am]Satan will [E]bow in de[F]feat,
[C]I'm [F]ready to [C]serve [G7]all of my [C]life.
