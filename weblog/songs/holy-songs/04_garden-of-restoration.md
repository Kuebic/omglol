{key: C}

In this world, embittered with hate, through the thousands of years,
Father was searching to find One triumphant in heart;
There, where He struggled behold, footprints stained with blood;
Such love is given to us in His providence;
Such love is given to us in His providence.

Here we find the flower of joy in the freedom of God;
His garden blesses the world with the blooming of hope;
Fragrant perfume of His will fills us all with joy;
Such life fulfills all the dreams of our Father's desire,
Such life fulfills all the dreams of our Father's desire.

Fresh bouquets of happiness grow, gently tossed in the breeze;
Our home eternal and true is a haven of joy;
Here in such beauty divine, we shall always live;
Such is the gift of the Lord, Father's heavenly land;
Such is the gift of the Lord, Father's heavenly land.

God's eternal providence is the Kingdom on earth;
On earth He wanted to see His true garden in bloom,
Filled with perfume of the heart, spread His glorious joy;
Such is the glory to come, crowning all of the world,
Such is the glory to come, crowning all of the world.
