[G]Win the whole world, [C]heaven and [G]earth,
[C]God's will for all shall [A]be ful[D7]filled;
[G]Teach to all men [C]God's divine [G]word,
[Em]Source of the [D]Fa[G]ther's [C]highest [G]truth
[G]Wake the mighty land that re[C]mains a[G]sleep;
[D]Loudly ring the [G]bell and proclaim to [D]all;
[G]Fighting on till the day [C]Satan falls [G]in defeat,
[C]I'll take the [G]task on [D]by my[G]self.
[G]Share the persecution that [C]Jesus [B7]knew,
[Am7]Suffering a[G]buse from the [D]mocking [G]crowd.

[G]Win the whole world, [C]heaven and [G]earth,
[C]God's will for all shall [A]be ful[D7]filled;
[G]Teach to all men [C]God's divine [G]word,
[Em]Source of the [D]Fa[G]ther's [C]blessed [G]grace.
[G]Two hundred million in [C]darkness [G]dwell;
[D]Bring to the [G]fire giving light to [D]all;
[G]Fighting on till the day [C]Satan falls [G]in defeat,
[C]I'll hold the [G]burden [D]by my[G]self.
[G]Share the heart of sadness that [C]Jesus [B7]felt,
[Am7]Praying in the [G]Garden a[D]lone with [G]God.

[G]Win the whole world, [C]heaven and [G]earth,
[C]God's will for all shall [A]be ful[D7]filled;
[G]Teach to all men [C]God's divine [G]word,
[Em]Source of the [D]Fa[G]ther's deepest life.
[G]Tell the universe in the [C]black of [G]night;
[D]Shout it with a [G]strong voice awakening [D]all;
[G]Fighting on till the day [C]Satan falls [G]in defeat,
[C]I'll fight the [G]battle [D]by my[G]self.
[G]Take the cross and follow as [C]Jesus [B7]did,
[Am7]Dying on the [G]mountain at [D]Calva[G]ry.

[G]Win the whole world, [C]heaven and [G]earth,
[C]God's will for all shall [A]be ful[D7]filled;
[G]Teach to all men [C]God's divine [G]word,
[Em]Source of the [D]Fa[G]ther's greatest love.
[G]Tell the people trapped in a [C]world of [G]fear;
[D]Raising up the [G]flag, we will free them [D]all;
[G]Fighting on till the day [C]Satan falls [G]in defeat,
[C]I'll perse[G]vere now [D]by my[G]self.
[G]Let our Father rest from His [C]lonely [B7]toil,
[Am7]History a[G]waits us to [D]do His [G]will.
