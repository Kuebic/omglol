Win the whole world, heaven and earth,
God's will for all shall be fulfilled;
Teach to all men God's divine word,
Source of the Father's highest truth
Wake the mighty land that remains asleep;
Loudly ring the bell and proclaim to all;
Fighting on till the day Satan falls in defeat,
I'll take the task on by myself.
Share the persecution that Jesus knew,
Suffering abuse from the mocking crowd.

Win the whole world, heaven and earth,
God's will for all shall be fulfilled;
Teach to all men God's divine word,
Source of the Father's blessed grace.
Two hundred million in darkness dwell;
Bring to the fire giving light to all;
Fighting on till the day Satan falls in defeat,
I'll hold the burden by myself.
Share the heart of sadness that Jesus felt,
Praying in the Garden alone with God.

Win the whole world, heaven and earth,
God's will for all shall be fulfilled;
Teach to all men God's divine word,
Source of the Father's deepest life.
Tell the universe in the black of night;
Shout it with a strong voice awakening all;
Fight on on till the day Satan falls in defeat,
I'll fight the battle by myself.
Take the cross and follow as Jesus did,
Dying on the mountain at Calvary.

Win the whole world, heaven and earth,
God's will for all shall be fulfilled;
Teach to all men God's divine word,
Source of the Father's greatest love.
Tell the people trapped in a world of fear;
Raising up the flag, we will free them all;
Fighting on till the day Satan falls in defeat,
I'll persevere now by myself.
Let our Father rest from His lonely toil,
History awaits us to do His will.
