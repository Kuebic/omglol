Where are His children who answered the call
Of the archangel sounding afar?
People who trembled as lightning flashed,
Blazing the sky from the East to the West,
Dark is the sun, dim is the moon,
Thousands of stars falling to darkness;
Where are the ones blessed with new life,
Liberated from the dead?

Now we behold a new heaven and earth,
Holy Jerusalem, standing anew;
After our search of six thousand years,
Eden rejoices to welcome us home.
All of our tears, wipe them away;
Sorrowful sighs, we will not need them;
Where is my Lord, He who returns?
Where is Heaven's glorious One?

Once He departed by way of the cross,
Now He returns and He suffers again;
One way is given to me our Lord;
Follow the path to the bottom of hell.
Glorious star, Lebanon's light,
Shining on all, lighting the ages;
There is the great city of God,
Where the sun arises and shines.

Come in rejoicing and look to the light,
See how the darkness is rolling away;
Out of the few come a multitude;
Joyfully building the city of God.
Children of life stream thru the gates,
Close to His heart, singing to please Him;
Raising the white cross to the sky,
Praising our eternal new life.
