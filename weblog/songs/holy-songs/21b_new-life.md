[G]Where are His [D]children who [Em]answered the [G]call
[C]Of the arch[G]angel [A7]sounding a[D7]far?
[G]People who [D]trembled as [Em]lightning [G]flashed,
[C]Blazing the [G]sky from the [D]East to the [G]West,
[G]Dark is the [D]sun, [G]dim is the [C]moon,
[G]Thousands of [D]stars [G]falling to [D7]dark[G]ness;
[G]Where are the ones [C]blessed with new [E7]life,
[Am]Liberated [G]from [D7]the [G]dead?

[G]Now we be[D]hold a new [Em]heaven and [G]earth,
[C]Holy Je[G]rusalem, [A7]standing a[D7]new;
[G]After our [D]search of six [Em]thousand [G]years,
[C]Eden re[G]joices to [D]welcome us [G]home.
[G]All of our [D]tears, [G]wipe them a[C]way;
[G]Sorrowful [D]sighs, [G]we will not [D7]need [G]them;
[G]Where is my Lord, [C]He who re[E7]turns?
[Am]Where is Heaven's [G]glori[D7]ous [G]One?

[G]Once He de[D]parted by [Em]way of the [G]cross,
[C]Now He re[G]turns and He [A7]suffers a[D7]gain;
[G]One way is [D]given to [Em]me our [G]Lord;
[C]Follow the [G]path to the [D]bottom of [G]hell.
[G]Glorious [D]star, [G]Lebanon's [C]light,
[G]Shining on [D]all, [G]lighting the [D7]a[G]ges;
[G]There is the great [C]city of [E7]God,
[Am]Where the sun a[G]rises [D7]and [G]shines.

[G]Come in re[D]joicing and [Em]look to the [G]light,
[C]See how the [G]darkness is [A7]rolling a[D7]way;
[G]Out of the [D]few come a [Em]multi[G]tude;
[C]Joyfully [G]building the [D]city of [G]God.
[G]Children of [D]life [G]stream thru the [C]gates,
[G]Close to His [D]heart, [G]singing to [D7]please [G]Him;
[G]Raising the white [C]cross to the [E7]sky,
[Am]Praising our e[G]ternal [D7]new [G]life.
