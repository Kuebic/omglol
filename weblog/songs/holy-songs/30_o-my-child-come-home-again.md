{title: O My Child, Come Home Again}
{subtitle: Christian Korean hymn}
{key: C}

O my [C]child, come home a[Am]gain; How I [D]beg you to [G7]come [C]home.
Though your sin be deep and [Am]dark, and your [C]burden [F]hard [C]to [G7]bear,
Still the [C]Lord of all will for[F]give you, and ac[G]cept you [G7]in His [C]grace.
For the heart of God is [Am]deep and [G]wide,
[F]Boundless [C]and e[Dm]ternal [G7] His [C]love.

O my [C]child, come home a[Am]gain; How I [D]beg you to [G7]come [C]home.
How He searches every [Am]day, for the [C]children [F]of [C]His [G7]heart.
Every [C]night the Lord leaves the [F]doorway open [G]wide for [G7]their re[C]turn,
And He longs for them to [Am]come back [G]home,
[F]All the [C]ones who [Dm]left Him [G7] be[C]hind.

O my [C]child, come home a[Am]gain; How I [D]beg you to [G7]come [C]home.
Though the whip has stung your [Am]back, in the [C]tender [F]hands [C]of [G7]God,
All your [C]suffering path can be [F]lightened, and the [G]Lord can [G7]ease your [C]pain,
Come and rest within the [Am]Father's [G]heart,
[F]O my [C]children [Dm]quickly [G7] come [C]home.
