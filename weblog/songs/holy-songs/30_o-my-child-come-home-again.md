{title: O My Child, Come Home Again}
{subtitle: Christian Korean hymn}
{key: C}

O my child, come home again; How I beg you to come home.
Though your sin be deep and dark, and your burden hard to bear,
Still the Lord of all will forgive you, and accept you in His grace.
For the heart of God is deep and wide,
Boundless and eternal His love.

O my child, come home again; How I beg you to come home.
How He searches every day, for the children of His heart.
Every night the Lord leaves the doorway open wide for their return,
And He longs for them to come back home,
All the ones who left Him behind.

O my child, come home again; How I beg you to come home,
Though the whip has stung your back, in the tender hands of God,
All your suffering path can be lightened, and the Lord can ease your pain,
Come and rest within the Father's heart,
O my children quickly come home.
