{words: Hyo Min Eu}

{year: 1956}
{key: D}

Now [D]I have to come to know, I've truly come to know,
Father, how Your [G]heart is [A]filled with [D]tears,
For Your altar stands and [A]waits for an offering never [D]made. [D7]
He [G]cries through all the [D]ages [G]for [A]still no offering [D]comes,
Our [G]Father cries in [D]loneliness for He [A]cannot [A7]share His [D]heart.

Now [D]I have come to know, I've truly come to know,
Father, now I [G]know your [A]blessed [D]grace;
For you raised me from the [A]darkness and gave to me new [D]life.  [D7]
I [G]live and stand be[D]fore you, [G]but [A]now you cry a[D]gain.
My [G]Father has to [D]say to me, "Go and [A]die now [A7]in my [D]place."

Now [D]pledging I will go, determined I will go,
Father, now I'm [G]changing [A]to Your [D]way,
For no other will I [A]follow, but go my Father's [D]way  [D7]
U[G]pon Your waiting [D]altar [G]I [A]kneel without a [A]word.
My [G]life shall be the [D]sacrifice; I will [A]faithful[A7]ly o[D]bey.

**Note**
- This song was written by a cousin of the late President Eu. It was composed during a period when the church was being severely persecuted by the media. The melody came as an inspiration during one of Reverend Moon's sermons. The song reflects determination to accomplish God's will where so many have failed before. (Note the references to Abraham and Isaac.)
  --Footnote from one of the popular UC songbooks, unknown publishing date.
