{title: Suffering}
{words: Hyo Won Eu}
{music: Duk Chin Kim}
{year: 1956}
{time: 6/8}
{key: G}

[G]So many saints have [Em]journeyed this [G]road;
No one could [Em]make the [G]pathway com[D7]plete;
[G]Now at [B7]last He [C]opens the [G]way,
Calls us to [C]come, [D]waits for us [G]all;
All the host of [C]men and angels
[D7]Failed to do the [G]will of Heaven;
Now the Lord is [C]still awai[G]ting,
[Am]You alone must [G]answer [D7]His [G]call.

[G]Glory concealed, He [Em]suffers a[G]gain,
Wrongly ac[Em]cused of [G]lowliest [D7]crimes,
[G]Though His [B7]path is [C]thorny and [G]long
Still I must [C]go, [D]follow my [G]Lord;
In His presence [C]Eden blossoms,
[D7]So a dungeon [G]may be Eden;
Just to be with [C]my belo[G]ved,
[Am]I'd endure all [G]torture [D7]and [G]pain.

[G]I give my pledge to [Em]go with my [G]Lord,
I too shall [Em]walk the [G]way He has [D7]gone;
[G]Though I [B7]meet the [C]shadow of [G]death,
He is my [C]life, [D]I am His [G]own;
Strong desire [C]swells within me,
[D7]Leading me to [G]go be with Him;
In my heart such [C]strong desi[G]re,
[Am]Not a one can [G]stand in [D7]my [G]way.

[G]Shameless disgrace! You [Em]tie Him in [G]chains
Scorning my [Em]Lord, you [G]lead Him a[D7]way;
[G]Words and [B7]pictures [C]witness your [G]sin;
All men shall [C]know, [D]judgment shall [G]fall;
Blind officials [C]ridicule Him,
[D7]Still the high priests; [G]mock the Saviour;
Do you mean to [C]force upon [G]us
[Am]Tragedy and [G]suffering [D7]a[G]gain?
