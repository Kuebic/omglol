Sing Ho[D]sannas ever[A7]more! Sing of [D]glory ever[G]more!
For the [D]Lord has come a[Bm]gain, [G]Sing Ho[D]sannas [A7]ever[D]more!

Heaven [D]dances at the [A7]sound, All His [D]angels whirl a[G]round.
All cre[D]ation joining [Bm]in, [G]Dances [D]at the [A7]joyful [D]sound.

See the [D]new Jerusa[A7]lem, Coming [D]now upon the [G]earth.
For the [D]day is here at [Bm]last, [G]Now the [D]Lord is [A7]come at [D]last.

Brightly [D]burn, O Fire of [A7]Faith! Burn so [D]brightly every[G]where.
Light of [D]hope, burn to[Bm]day, [G]Kindling [D]every [A7]faithful [D]heart.

Land of [D]Egypt, land of [A7]woe, Waiting [D]for the Lord's re[G]turn.
Soon the [D]day will come at [Bm]last, [G]When the [D]Rose of [D7]Sharon [D]blooms.

March a[D]long, march a[A7]long, Have no [D]fear, but march a[G]long;
For you [D]go to victo[Bm]ry, [G]Heaven's [D]soldiers, [A7]march a[D]long.

Praise the [D]Lord, O praise the [A7]Lord! Praise the [D]glorious Lord of [G]all,
To the [D]Lord of truth and [Bm]love, [G]Sing to [D]Him e[A7]ternal [D]praise.

Sing Ho[D]sannas ever[A7]more! Sing of [D]glory ever[G]more!
For the [D]Lord has come a[Bm]gain, [G]Sing Ho[D]sannas [A7]ever[D]more!
