{subtitle: anonymous}
{key: C}

The [C]Lord into His garden com[Am]es;
The [C]spices yield a rich per[F]fume;
[G7]The [C]lilies grow and thr[Am]ive, the li[C]lies [G7]grow and [C]thrive.
[C7]Re[F]freshing showers of grace di[Am]vine,
From the [C]Father flow to every [F]vine,
And [C]make the dead rev[Am]ive, and [C]make the [G7]dead re[C]vive.

Oh [C]that this dry and barren gr[Am]ound
In [C]springs of water may a[F]bound;
[G7]A [C]fruitful soil be[Am]come, a [C]fruitful [G7]soil be[C]come.
[C7]The [F]desert blossoms as the [Am]rose,
When the [C]Saviour conquers all his [F]foes,
And [C]makes His people one[Am], and [C]makes His [G7]people [C]one.

Come [C]brethren you that love the Lo[Am]rd,
And [C]taste the sweetness of His [F]word;
[G7]In [C]Father's ways go [Am]on, in [C]Father's [G7]ways go [C]on,
[C7]Our [F]trouble and our trials [Am]here,
Will [C]only make us richer [F]there,
When [C]we arrive at ho[Am]me, when [C]we ar[G7]rive at [C]home.
