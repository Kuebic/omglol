[C]Longing to [Am]live in deepest [F]joy and love e[C]ternal,
[Dm]God was ever-[Am]seeking for a [F]people all His [C]own.
[C]Who can know the [Am]yearning of His [G]lonely [C]broken [F]heart?
Tears were [C]falling [Dm]as a [Em]river [F]through His countless [G7]years a[C]lone.
[F]Out of [C]all the [Am]multi[Em]tude [C]there was none who [G]knew
[C]How the Father's [F]heart was aching, [G]grieving [G7]after [C]man.

[C]Glorious [Am]God, who started [F]life throughout the [C]heavens,
[Dm]Bore the deepest [Am]torture as He [F]saw His children [C]die.
[C]Every day He [Am]seeks the beauty [G]lost in[C]side our [F]hearts,
Tender[C]ly with [Dm]love He [Em]leads us [F]back to life with [G7]Him on [C]high.
[F]How [C]many [Am]fathoms [Em]deep [C]is His aching [G]heart?
[C]All the tears He [F]shed for earth be[G]came an [G7]endless [C]sea.

[C]Deep from with[Am]in the heart of [F]heaven came the [C]secret,
[Dm]Now the mighty [Am]word, the trumpet [F]call will surely [C]sound.
[C]But as in the [Am]time of Noah [G]people [C]laugh and [F]mock,
Satis[C]fied to [Dm]wander [Em]aimless [F]in the darkness [G7]under[C]ground.
[F]Fearful [C]is the [Am]time to [Em]come [C]when the price is [G]paid!
[C]One and all will [F]face the judgment [G]from an [G7]angry [C]God.

[C]Quickly be[Am]lieve, my people [F]quickly turn and [C]follow!
[Dm]You can be en[Am]folded in the [F]warmth of Father's [C]heart.
[C]All the joy that [Am]life can offer [G]calls us [C]home to [F]Him,
Now He [C]calls you [Dm]to be [Em]near Him [F]never again to [G7]be a[C]part.
[F]When at [C]last we [Am]run to [Em]Him, [C]how He'll cry with [G]joy!
[C]All rejoicing, [F]all together [G]now and [G7]ever[C]more.
