Come unite the world you soldiers of Truth,
Chosen by the Lord to carry His Word.
Till the world proclaims Him ruler of all,
Every soldier must go forward to fight.
Offer God your life and desire, Uniting both the body and soul,
We shall be the soldiers who can fulfill,
Everything for God by doing His Will.

	Chorus:
	Join the fight for the Lord, sacrificing all that you have
	Join the fight, win the world! We will see victory!

Come unite the world you soldiers of light,
Called to be the chosen people of God.
Till the world returns all glory above,
Every soldier must go forward to march.
Offer God the wealth you possess,
Uniting from beginning to end,
We shall be the soldiers who can fulfill,
Heavenly desire by doing His will.

Come unite the world you soldiers of right,
Trusted by the Lord as worthy in heart,
Till the world is bright with Heavenly joy,
Every soldier must go forward to win.
Offer God the love in your heart,
Uniting on the left and the right,
 We shall be the soldiers who can fulfill,
God's eternal joy by doing His will.

Come unite the world you soldiers of life,
Ever to obey our Father's command,
Till the world returns His Heavenly love,
Every soldier must go forward in faith.
Offer God the people you love,
Uniting both the young and the old,
We shall be the soldiers who can fulfill,
One united world by doing His will.
