{words: Sang Chul Kim}
{music: Duk Chin Kim}
{year: 1958}
{key: C}

Beautiful morning sunrise, calm above the land of our hope;
Robed in white chosen people, fighting for the land of God.
Towering high the snow white mountain stands aloft in majesty.
Ruling with power over the world, shining o'er the universe.
Marching on Heavenly soldiers, marching on with His love,
Uniting in life eternal with our God in Heaven and earth.

Heavenly soldiers fighting strongly for the victory;
Bringing lost souls to harvest from the fallen world of fear,
Freely giving love and beauty to them from our Parents' Heart.
Spreading the word over the world, rescuing the family of God.
Marching on Heavenly soldiers, marching on with His love,
Uniting in life eternal w*h our God in Heaven and earth.

Sanctified, brave crusaders, join in our True Parents' fight;
Lifting high the rod of iron, smashing evils of the world!
Now restoring Eden's glory, on the earth eternally,
Praising our God, Heavenly Father, giving joy to comfort His heart
Marching on Heavenly soldiers, marching on with His love.
Uniting in life eternal with our God in Heaven and earth.
