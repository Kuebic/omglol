{sov: VERSE 1}
Beauti[A]ful morning sunrise, [D]calm above the land of our [A]hope;
Robed in [E7]white [A]chosen people, [E]fighting for the [E7]land of [A]God.
Towering high the [D]snow white mountain [Bm]stands aloft in [E]maje[E7]sty.
[A]Ruling with power [F#m]over the world, [Bm]shining o'er the [A]u[E7]ni[A]verse.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
Marching on Heavenly [D]sol[A]diers, [F#m]marching on [Bm]with His [E]love,
[F#m]U[D]niting in [Bm]life e[E]ternal [A]with our God in [E7]Heaven and [A]earth.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
Heaven[A]ly soldiers fighting [D]strongly for the victo[A]ry;
Bringing [E7]lost [A]souls to harvest [E]from the fallen [E7]world of [A]fear,
[A]Freely giving [D]love and beauty [Bm]to them from our [E]Parents' [E7]Heart.
[A]Spreading the word [F#m]over the world, [Bm]rescuing the [A]family [E7]of [A]God.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
Marching on Heavenly [D]sol[A]diers, [F#m]marching on [Bm]with His [E]love,
[F#m]U[D]niting in [Bm]life e[E]ternal [A]with our God in [E7]Heaven and [A]earth.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 3}
Sancti[A]fied, brave crusaders, [D]join in our True Parents' [A]fight;
Lifting [E7]high the [A]rod of iron, [E]smashing evils [E7]of the [A]world!
Now restoring [D]Eden's glory, [Bm]on the earth e[E]ternal[E7]ly,
[A]Praising our God, [F#m]Heavenly Father, [Bm]giving joy to [A]comfort [E7]His [A]heart
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
Marching on Heavenly [D]sol[A]diers, [F#m]marching on [Bm]with His [E]love,
[F#m]U[D]niting in [Bm]life e[E]ternal [A]with our God in [E7]Heaven and [A]earth.
{eoc}
