[C]Darkness gaining power within, [Am]tempting my [C]soul to [G]fall. [G7]
[C]Weak is my heart, [G]blurred are my [Am]thoughts, [G]soon I am [D]over[G]come. [G7]
[Am]Blind to the truth, [C]losing the way, [Dm]thinking of my[G]self; [G7]
[C]So I can see [F]how sin began [G]sprouting with[G7]in my [C]soul. [G7]

[C]When my Lord came over to me, [Am]I would not [C]hear His [G]voice; [G7]
[C]Blinded and deaf, [G]closing my [Am]heart, [G]I ran a[D]way from [G]Him. [G7]
[Am]So I remained [C]lost in desire [Dm]only for my[G]self.  [G7]

[C]To restore the black lonely night [Am]held by the [C]power of [G]sin,  [G7]
[C]Deserts He crossed, [G]walking the [Am]way, [G]climbing the [D]rocky [G]peaks.  [G7]
[Am]Searching for us [C]people of sin [Dm]who deserve to [G]die,  [G]
[C]How then could I [F]ever begin [G]thanking the [G7]Lord for such [C]grace?  [G7]

[C]To defeat the power of death, [Am]fighting the [C]realm of [G]sin.  [G7]
[C]I sought the Lord, [G]longing for [Am]Him, [G]Bridegroom [D]of my [G]soul.  [G7]
[Am]Tortured my heart, [C]suffering alone, [Dm]fighting deepest [G]pain,  [G7]
[C]Finally today [F]I greet the Lord, [G]gaining all [G7]comfort from [C]Him.  [G7]
[C]Finally today [F]I greet the Lord, [C]gaining all [G]comfort [G7]from [C]Him.  [G7]

[C]Now I behold, [G]Heavenly [Am]life, [G]glory and [D]happi[G]ness.  [G7]
[Am]Always before [C]stung by my sin, [Dm]I was doomed to [G]die.  [G7]
[C]Finally today [F]I am reborn, [G]filled with a[G7]bundant new [C]life,  [G7]
[C]Finally today [F]I am reborn, [C]filled with a[G]bundant [G7]new [C]life.  [G7]

[C]O my dearest Heavenly bride, [Am]now you've come [C]home at [G]last,  [G7]
[C]Deserts you crossed, [G]searching for [Am]me, [G]climbing the [D]rocky [G]peaks;  [G7]
[Am]You persevered, [C]faithful to me, [Dm]longing for this [G]day.  [G7]
[C]How you've become [F]lovely to see [G]through all your [G7]suffering and [C]pain,  [G7]

[C]Come, O come, together we'll sing [Am]songs of e[C]ternal [G]praise. [G7]
[C]Taste now my love, [G]treasure so [Am]pure, [G]Heaven's [D]gift for [G]you;  [G7]
[Am]All of my heart [C]waited for you, [Dm]yearning for this [G]day.  [G7]
