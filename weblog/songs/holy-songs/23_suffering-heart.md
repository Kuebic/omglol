{title: Suffering Heart}
{words: Rev. Sun Myung Moon}
{music: Duk Chin Kim}
{year: 1951}
{key: C}

Darkness gaining power within, tempting my soul to fall.
Weak is my heart, blurred are my thoughts, soon I am overcome.
Blind to the truth, losing the way, thinking of myself;
So I can see how sin began sprouting within my soul.
So I can see how sin began sprouting within my soul.

When my Lord came over to me, I would not hear His voice;
Blinded and deaf, closing my heart, I ran away from Him.
So I remained lost in desire only for myself.
Grieving the Lord suffered for me, going again to the cross.
Grieving the Lord suffered for me, going again to the cross.

To restore the black lonely night held by the power of sin,
Deserts He crossed, walking the way, climbing the rocky peaks.
Searching for us people of sin who deserve to die,
How then could I ever begin thanking the Lord for such grace?
How then could I ever begin thanking the Lord for such grace?

To defeat the power of death, fighting the realm of sin.
I sought the Lord, longing for Him, Bridegroom of my soul.
Tortured my heart, suffering alone, fighting deepest pain,
Finally today I greet the Lord, gaining all comfort from Him.
Finally today I greet the Lord, gaining all comfort from Him.

Joy eternal lifting my heart, swelling within my breast;
Now I behold, Heavenly life, glory and happiness.
Always before stung by my sin, I was doomed to die.
Finally today I am reborn, filled with abundant new life,
Finally today I am reborn, filled with abundant new life.

O my dearest Heavenly bride, now you've come home at last,
Deserts you crossed, searching for me, climbing the rocky peaks;
You persevered, faithful to me, longing for this day.
How you've become lovely to see through all your suffering and pain,
How you've become lovely to see through all your suffering and pain.

Come, O come, together we'll sing songs of eternal praise.
Taste now my love, treasure so pure, Heaven's gift for you;
All of my heart waited for you, yearning for this day.
All of my heart waited for you now I can give you my love.
All of my heart waited for you now I can give you my love.
