{sov: VERSE 1}
[C]Light that drives out the darkness is [F]shining brightly from the [G]East. [G7]
[C]Sons and [E7]daughters of [F]light are dwelling [C]in the [G]Garden [C]there.
[C]This is God's land of [F]righteous[C]ness, chosen by [D]Him to [G]do His will;
[C]These are God's people, [F]chosen [C]ones, [Am]upright in [D]mind and [G]heart. [G7]
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[C]As we [E7]now receive the [F]love of God,
our [Am]boundless source of [Em]light, [G7]
[C]Come, [E7]let's join to[F]gether and in [C]brightness [Dm]we shall [G]live;
[C]We'll [E7]shine like the [F]brightest star to [C]all of [G7]heaven and [C]earth!
{eoc}

[C]Good that wins over evil is [F]now uniting in the [G]East. [G7]
[C]People [E7]longing for [F]good are dwelling [C]in the [G]garden [C]there.
[C]Country of prayer and [F]holy [C]life, honoring [D]God e[G]ternally;
[C]People who wear the [F]robe of [C]white, [Am]sacrificing [D]for the [G]Lord;  [G7]

[C]Love that ends all the hatred is [G]now to blossom in the [G]East.  [G7]
[C]Men re[E7]fusing to [F]sin are dwelling [C]in the [G]garden [C]there.
[C]Ridiculed and re[F]jected [C]land, separates [D]good from [G]sinfulness;
[C]People who know the [F]thorny [C]path [Am]knowing God's [D]wondrous [G]love;  [G7]

[C]Greatest victory eternal is [F]now beginning in the [G]East. [G7]
[C]Those who [E7]crush evil [F]ways are dwelling [C]in the [G]garden [C]there.
[C]Country divided [F]North and [C]South truly knows [D]good from [G]sinfulness;
[C]People who shed their [F]precious [C]blood, [Am]given for the [D]sins of [G]men;  [G7]

[C]Brilliant glory of Heaven now [F]comes in power from the [G]East.  [G7]
[C]Those who [E7]carry the [F]cross, are dwelling [C]in the [G]garden [C]there.
[C]Country where soon the [F]Sun will [C]rise, welcoming [D]soon the [G]Son of Man;
[C]There the bright Rose of [F]Sharon [C]blooms, [Am]beautiful [D]garden of [G]God;  [G7]
