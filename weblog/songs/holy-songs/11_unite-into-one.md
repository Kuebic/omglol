{title: Unite into One}
{subtitle:}
{key: C}

Chase away the power of Satan, far away beyond the land and sea;
Build for God a boundless Kingdom, giving joy and liberty to all.
Come, ye people all around the world, let's unit into one;
Spreading forth the glory of the Father, and His great will forevermore.

	Chorus:
	Unite, Unite, let's unite into one
	Bring about one nation uniting all the people of the world.

Raise the white cross on our banner, high upon Mt. Everest it waves;
In the blue Pacific waters, cleanse the sword that brought the victory.
Come, ye people all around the world, let's unite into one.
Now resolve to end the deep resentment, of the long centuries past

Build a fortress to defend the peace, on the great new heaven and new earth;
We will all sing 'Hallelujah,' safe within the bosom of the Lord.
Come, ye people all around the world, let's unite into one.
Share the joy and glory of Heaven, hidden so long from every eye.
```
