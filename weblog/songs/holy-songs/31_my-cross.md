{sov: VERSE 1}
Who [C]can I [F]go to for my [C]help to [Am]bear my [Dm]heavy [G7]cross?
Has [C]not the [F]Lord been [C]helping me be[Dm]fore I [G7]ever [C]knew?
Be[Dm]cause I [G7]had no [C]strength to bear the [G]load He [G7]gave to [C]me,
Six [(C)]thousand years of [F]blood was [C]shed, [F]the [C]thorny [G7]path pro[C]longed.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
I will [(C)]shoulder [F]now the [C]cross, and [Am]pledge I [Dm]shall en[G7]dure;
Far be[C]yond Golgotha's [F]pain, now [C]hear the [G7]victo[C]ry.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
The [C]Lord would [F]never give to [C]me a [Am]cross I [Dm]could not [G7]bear.
If [C]I give [F]all the [C]strength I have I [Dm]shall a[G7]chieve the [C]goal.
I [Dm]sacri[G7]fice to [C]do His will, no [G]trial I [G7]cannot [C]bear.
I [C]give my life to [F]go this [C]way, [F]no [C]one can [G7]turn me [C]back.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
I will [(C)]shoulder [F]now the [C]cross, and [Am]pledge I [Dm]shall en[G7]dure;
Far be[C]yond Golgotha's [F]pain, now [C]hear the [G7]victo[C]ry.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 3}
Our [C]Father [F]always perse[C]vered to [Am]see His [Dm]will be [G7]done,
If [C]all His [F]children [C]join the task it [Dm]soon will [G7]be a[C]chieved.
If [Dm]not, the [G7]lonely [C]years of strife will [G]all have [G7]been in [C]vain.
No [C]matter what, in [F]fighting [C]on, [F]we'll [C]win e[G7]ternal [C]joy.
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
I will [(C)]shoulder [F]now the [C]cross, and [Am]pledge I [Dm]shall en[G7]dure;
Far be[C]yond Golgotha's [F]pain, now [C]hear the [G7]victo[C]ry.
{eoc}
