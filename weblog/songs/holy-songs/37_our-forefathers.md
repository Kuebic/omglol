Our forefathers built for us a beautiful land;
Till it is completed, we will join in heart and hand.
See the new eternal history, beckoning us to come
Quickly on the journey to the true eternal home.
How the beauty of our native land lifts us to the skies;
God has surely chosen this eternal paradise.
```
