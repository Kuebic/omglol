{key: C}

[C]Our forefathers built for us a [Am]beautiful [G7]land;
[C]Till it is completed, we will [Am]join in [G7]heart and [C]hand.
See the [Am]new e[G]ternal [C]history, beckoning [Am]us [G]to [C]come
Quickly on the [Am]journey to the [C]true e[G7]ternal [C]home.
How the beauty [G]of our [C]native land [F]lifts us [C]to the [G]skies;
[C]God has surely [Am]chosen this [C]eternal [G7]para[C]dise.
