{words: Jai Bong Dak}
{music: Jai Hoon Pak}
{key: C}

O come my Lord; I beg You to come.
O come to me and live within my heart;
Come live in my heart so black and impure,
That bears the burden of my sin.
O come! My Lord, You are the fire that burns so bright;
Come burn within my heart and cleans my sins,
O how I pray that You will come soon;
Come to me O Lord, Live within my heart.

O come my Lord; I beg You to come.
Come dwell with me my altar now awaits;
O come to the altar waiting for you,
But lost and hidden by the night.
O come! My Lord, You are the light that fills the world;
Come purify my altar by Your light.
O how I pray that You will come soon;
Many altars wait, Dwell with them, O Lord.

O come my Lord; I beg You to come.
O come and bring new life to all the earth;
O come save the world from dying in pain;
Restore our sinful world.
O come! My Lord, You are the strength that will not change;
Come end our evil ways and tragic times.
O how I pray that You will come soon;
Crying my heart, Come to us, O Lord.
