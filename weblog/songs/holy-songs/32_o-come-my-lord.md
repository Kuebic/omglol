O [C]come my [G]Lord; I [F]beg You to [C]come.
O [D]come to me and [G]live within my [G7]heart;
Come [C]live in my [G]heart so [F]black and im[C]pure,
That [G]bears the [D]burden of my [G]sin.
O [C]come! My [F]Lord, You are the [Dm]fire that [G7]burns so [C]bright;
Come [F]burn within my [Dm]heart and [C]cleans my [G]sins,
[C]O how I [G]pray that [F]You will come [C]soon;
[C]Come to me O [G]Lord, Live with[G7]in my [C]heart. [(F/C)]  [(C)]

O [C]come my [G]Lord; I [F]beg You to [C]come.
Come [D]dwell with me my [G]altar now a[G7]waits;
O [C]come to the [G]altar [F]waiting for [C]you,
But [G]lost and [D]hidden by the [G]night.
O [C]come! My [F]Lord, You are the [Dm]light that [G7]fills the [C]world;
Come [F]purify my [Dm]altar [C]by Your [G]light.
[C]O how I [G]pray that [F]You will come [C]soon;
[C]Many altars [G]wait, Dwell with [G7]them, O [C]Lord. [(F/C)]  [(C)]

O [C]come my [G]Lord; I [F]beg You to [C]come.
O [D]come and bring new [G]life to all the [G7]earth;
O [C]come save the [G]world from [G]dying in [C]pain;
Re[G]store our [D]sinful [G]world.
O [C]come! My [F]Lord, You are the [Dm]strength that [G7]will not [C]change;
Come [F]end our evil [Dm]ways and [C]tragic [G]times.
[C]O how I [G]pray that [F]You will come [C]soon;
[C]Crying my [G]heart, Come to [G7]us, O [C]Lord.  [F/C]  [C]
