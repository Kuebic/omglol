See Lord Jesus bent in prayer, in the garden late at night,
See Lord Jesus bent in prayer, in the garden late at night.
See Him crying sweating blood watch it mingle with His tears;
Twelve disciples all asleep, even Peter nods and snores.
Iscariot comes with a kiss, hands Him over He is betrayed.
How could it be? Tragic sight innocent Lord precious Lord.
Twelve disciples watch from afar, everyone is running away.
Jesus alone captured and chained; soldiers lead Him to the prison.
Frightened Peter runs from the scene; with his tunic hides his face;
Look at Peter treacherous man, now pretends he does not know.
He who made the lame leap for joy, He who made the blind man see,
He who freely walked on the waves, where are all those miracles now?

See Lord Jesus bent in shame, see Him bear His heavy cross,
See Lord Jesus bent in shame, see Him bear His heavy cross.
Spent, exhausted, body and soul, now He stumbles and He falls;
Whipped from behind, driven along, Jesus treated just like a cow,
Where are His men? Where are the twelve? Jesus now is standing alone.
Not even one man is there bearing the cross for his Lord.
Tho' the crowd may pity a thief, freeing sinful men of this world,
Who'd volunteer to take His place, take the cross for God's son Jesus?
How very sad, how very sad, mighty Father shedding tears;

Lost and betrayed, lost and betrayed, all the Father's hopes are gone.

Even the most ignorant men have a shred of common sense;

Who can see the Father's despair, who can share His suffering pain?
 See Lord Jesus on the cross, nails are hammered through His hands,
See Lord Jesus on the cross, nails are hammered through His hands.
What kind of sin did He commit, this, the only Son of God?
Like a pure innocent sheep, He is dying, dying for you.
Father above He cannot watch; When He turns His face from His Son.
"My God, my God" Jesus cries "Why do you now forsake me?"
Twelve disciples shared all His ways, still were deaf and blind to His heart
All gone to waste, all gone to waste, Providence of God is broken
No use now to cry and repent, all repentance comes too late.
To prepare His coming again, sacrifices must be found.
All the faithful shedding their blood, spilling for two thousand years.
All this bloodshed, salvation's price, for three billion men of today.
