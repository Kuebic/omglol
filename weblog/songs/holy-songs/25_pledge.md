{key: D}

[D]My fallen figure shames [G]the [D]earth;
Once I was [G]born, yet [A]never I [D]lived,
Never for[G]saking, [F#m]You came to [Bm]me
[Em]Giving my [D]life and [G]breaking my [D]chains
[Bm]Tenderly You [F#m]gathered me up;
[Bm]Filled with love and [A]sweating [A7]blood,
[Em]Ever patient, You [F#m]taught me the word,
[D]Carved in my [Em]heart, it for[A]ever re[D]mains.

[D]Never I knew what [G]life should [D]be;
All I can [G]do is [A]follow your [D]way.
When on the [G]path, I [F#m]stumble and [Bm]fall,
[Em]Turning, You [D]give the [G]courage I [D]need.
[Bm]Though the path is [F#m]narrow and steep;
[Bm]Cruel thorns leave a [A]trail of [A7]blood.
[Em]Still I pledge I will [F#m]follow the way,
[D]Follow as [Em]far as my [A]Father will [D]lead.

[D]Freed from a sleep so [G]deep and [D]dark,
Gladly I [G]wake to [A]knowing your [D]will.
Though death may [G]stab me [F#m]time and a[Bm]gain,
[Em]Nothing can [D]change a [G]loyal [D]heart.
[Bm]This I pledge, my [F#m]life is for You;
[Bm]For Your will I rush [A]forward to [A7]die.
[Em]This I pledge till the [F#m]struggle is done,
[D]'Till we pro[Em]claim the vic[A]torious [D]day.
