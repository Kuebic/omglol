{sov: VERSE 1}
[C]There comes a time when we [F/C]heed a [G/C]certain [C]call
When the [F]world must [G7]come together as [C]one
There are [Am]people dying
And it's [Em]time to lend a hand to [Dm7]life
The [F/D]greatest gift of [G]all
{eov}

{sov: VERSE 2}
[C]We can't go on pre-[F/C]tending [G/C]day by [C]day
That some-[F]one some-[G7]where
will soon make a [C]change
We are [Am]all a part of God's [Em]great big family
And the [Dm7]truth, you know
[F/D]Love is all we [G]need
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
We are the [F]world    [G]
We are the [C]children
We are the [F]ones who make a brighter [G]day
So, let's start [C]giving
There's a [Am]choice we're making
We're [Em]saving our own lives
It's [F/D]true we'll make a better [G]day
Just you and [C]me
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 3}
[C]Send them your heart so they'll [F/C]know that [G/C]someone [C]cares
And their [F]lives will [G7]be stronger and [C]free
As [Am]God has shown us by [Em]turning stone to bread
And so [F/D]we all must lend a helping [G]hand

{eoc}

{c: BRIDGE}
When you're [Ab]down and out
There [Bb]seems no hope at [C]all
But if you [Ab]just believe
There's [Bb]no way we can [C]fall
Let us [Am]realize that a [Em]change can only come
When [F/D]we stand together as [G]one

{soc: CHORUS x2}
We are the [F]world    [G]
We are the [C]children

We all need somebody that we can lean on
when you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
when the earth quakes we’ll help you make it through the storm
when the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
we are the World united by love so strong
when the radio isn’t on you can hear the songs
a guided light on the dark road your walking on
a sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
someone to help you rebuild after the rubble’s gone
we are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along

{soc: CHORUS X3}
We are the [Bb]world, [C] we are the chil[F]dren [F7]
We are the o[Bb]nes who make a brighter [C]day so let's start [F]giving
There's a [Dm]choice we're making we're [Am]saving our own lives
It's [Bb]true we'll make a better [C]day just you and [F]me
{eoc}
