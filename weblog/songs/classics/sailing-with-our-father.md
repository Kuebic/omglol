{sov: VERSE 1}
[G]If the trip you’re traveling gets [D]long,
[Am]Wishing for a new day to [G]come;
[D]When the sun rises in the [Am]morning
[C]We’ll set sail and move [G]on.
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 1}
[D]Sailing with our [Am]Father
[C]You know His ship will never [G]sway;
[D]New Hope on the [Am]horizon
[C]We’ve found the Promised Land [Em]today.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
[G]Look out with joy in your [D]eyes,
[Am]The winds of truth will guide our [G]way;
[D]Leaving behind the raging [Am]sea,
[C]On waves of Love we’ll sail [G]away.
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 2}
[D]Sailing with our [Am]Father
[C]You know His ship will never [G]sway;
[D]New Hope on the [Am]horizon
[C]We’ve found the Promised Land [Em]today.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 3}
[G]Darkness it always turns to [D]light,
[Am]The Promised Land is in [G]sight;
[D]He is our guiding star by [Am]night
[C]And in the day our bright [G]sunlight.
{eov}

{soc: Chorus 3}
[D]Sailing with our [Am]Father
[C]You know His ship will never [G]sway;
[D]New Hope on the [Am]horizon
[C]We’ve found the Promised Land [G]today.
{eoc}
