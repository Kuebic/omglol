{key: D}

{sov: VERSE 1}
[C]Life is [F]pure, the [C]world is new,
The [F]sun be[Dm7]gins to [G]rise [G7]
[C]Love is [F]here, and [Em]we are [Am]free
To [F]see through [G7]children's [C]eyes.    [C7]
{eov}

{soc: CHORUS}
[F]So the truth shall [G]make us free
Why [F]walk when we can [G]fly?
[Am]On the [Em]wings of [Am]God's true [Am7]love,
[F]Higher [G]than the [C]sky.
{eoc}

{sov: VERSE 2}
[C]Fear and [F]doubt shall [C]pass away;
His [F]heart no [Dm7]longer [G]cries; [G7]
[C]As we [F]can per[Em]fect our [Am]love,
And [F]see through [G7]children's [C]eyes.    [C7]
{eov}

{sov: VERSE 3}
[C]Here we [F]learn to [C]live for all,
[F]Choosing [Dm7]to be [G]wise;    [G7]
[C]Measure [F]not the [Em]things you [Am]give,
Just [F]see through [G7]children's [C]eyes.    [C7]
{eov}

{sov: VERSE 4}
[C]If you [F]choose to [C]live this way,
[F]Joy will [Dm7]fill your [G]lives;    [G7]
[C]We will [F]give our [Em]best so [Am]all
Can [F]see through [G7]children's [C]eyes.    [C7]
{eov}
